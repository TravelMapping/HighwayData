Way down deep 
in the middle of the Congo, 
A hippo took an apricot, 
a guava and a mango. 
He stuck it with the others, 
and he danced a dainty tango. 
The rhino said, 

"I know, we'll call it Um Bongo" 
Um Bongo, 
Um Bongo, 
They drink it in the Congo. 
The python picked the passion fruit, 
the marmoset the mandarin. 
The parrot painted packets, 
that the whole caboodle landed in. 
So when it comes to 
sun and fun and goodness
in the jungle, 
They all prefer 
the sunny funny one they call Um Bongo!
