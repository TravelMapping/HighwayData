Notes:
- `A1` km 0 is at the next interchange south of `A12`. The section is indicated as `A1` on infraestruturasdeportugal.pt and OSM but the end of motorway sign is at the `A12` interchange. Included though.
- `IC2` is signed through Batalha (south of Leiria) on 2022 GSV although infraestruturasdeportugal.pt and OSM indicate it via `A19`. `A19` has no `IC2` signs. Keeping through through Batalha.
- `IC2` is signed north of Oliveira de Azeméis up to Arrifana (end of expressway) on 2022 GSV (and OSM) although infraestruturasdeportugal.pt indicates it heading to `A32`. Drafted according to GSV + OSM.
- `IC2` is again indicated from Lourosa to Carvalhos on OSM but not confirmed by GSV. Not drafted.
- `IC3 (Alcochete)` is also indicated on infraestruturasdeportugal.pt and OSM north of Alcochete but it is not signed according to 2021 GSV
- In general, infraestruturasdeportugal.pt and OSM often indicate road numbers which are not signed in the field
- `IC30` is indicated on OSM from Pero Pinheiro to A16 but it's not signed on 2022 GSV nor a dedicated road on infraestruturasdeportugal.pt
