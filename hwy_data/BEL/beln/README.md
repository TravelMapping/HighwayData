- `N772` is also indicated on GM from Koersel to the south (not extended)
- `N89`/`N820`/`N833`/`N834`/`N860` in La Roche-en-Ardenne: Signage has been changed as you can see on GSV. Moving the position and signs disappear... I've gone with OSM, no evidence that `N820` is really signed.
- `N862` (partially P7 on signs) should exist according to OSM but not on GM nor GSV

- `N205`, `N206`, `N210`, `N215`, `N219`, `N220`, `N236`, `N247`, `N256`, `N265`, `N274`, `N281`, `N289`, `N291`, `N292`, `N294`, `N295`, `N334`, `N335`, `N342`, `N422`, `N473`, `N556`, `N756`, `N764` and `N824` should exist according to wegenwiki, wikisara and GM but not on OSM nor GSV
- `N57b`, `N76a`, `N213`, `N216`, `N225`, `N228`, `N235`, `N242`, `N244`, `N248`, `N254`, `N284`, `N288`, `N293`, `N296`, `N297`, `N298`, `N299`, `N310`, `N378`, `N404`, `N426`, `N522`, `N578`, `N605`, `N628`, `N732` and `N869` should exist according to wegenwiki and wikisara but not indicated on any map

- One-way streets are generally not drafted when they have just an additional or different prefix, e.g. `N114a`, since that's what our rules say
- `N24` is not signed according to wegenwiki and only indicated on GM
- `N34g` should exist (not being signed) according to wegenwiki (length of just 200m) and wikisara but it's not indicated on GSV nor GM and OSM seems to indicate it wrong (not from N34 to the station but from the station to the north)
- `N40a` should exist according to wegenwiki but is no longer indicated on OSM, GM nor verkeerscentrum.be as-of 2023 (assuming being downgraded)
- Spa-Francorchamps Circuit bypass should be signed `N62c` according to OSM and GM but not on GSV, included to `N62`
- `N96a` should be signed according to wegenwiki but not on any map
- `N114b` is indicated on OSM + wegenenverkeer.be, but not on GM nor GSV. It is just a short connection between `N114` and a feeder for `A12` The feeder is signed as `A12` (as all interchanges) and not in HB. The feeder has two wps at `A12`, i.e. there is no natural end point for `N114b` if we would extend it onto the feeder
- `N395a` and `N395b` are concurrent to R8, the northern carriageway is `N395a`, the southern carriageway `N395b`
- `N402` has a length of 0.17km only and is signed `N462`
- `N420` should exist according to wegenwiki but not indicated on any map
- `N540` was signed at N57 according to 2010 GSV but not indicated on OSM nor GM; sign was removed according to Sep 2021 GSV
- `N603` should exist according to wegenwiki but wikisara indicates it being the old numbering of new `N3g`
- `N607a` should exist according to wikisara and GM but not on OSM nor GSV
- `N616` is signed concurrent on `N696` once
- `N722a` seems to be downgraded like all routes in the center of Sint-Truiden
- `N832` is only signed once at `N865` junction in Cugnon but the route is not indicated on OSM nor GM
