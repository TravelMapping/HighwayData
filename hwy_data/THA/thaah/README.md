Notes on routes:
* AH1 is assumed to have been moved to the new Thl33 near Prachin Buri, rather than remaining on old Thl33 (now Thl3649).
* AH1Nak and AH2Nak are well-signed and included to provide a connection for AH13.
* AH2 is shown using Thl338 in both sources, but [signs](https://www.google.com/maps/@13.7692181,100.182497,3a,56.5y,158.11h,115.87t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sQqUNx2F5poGIQg4OwPB0Rw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DQqUNx2F5poGIQg4OwPB0Rw%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.share%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26yaw%3D158.10681830277878%26pitch%3D-25.86914652757244%26thumbfov%3D90!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu) are clear about it staying on Thl4.
* AH2 is clearly signed to use the new Thl376 around Ratchaburi.
* AH3 is assumed to use the new bridge to Laos.
* AH12 [is signed thru Saraburi](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.5438383,100.9574046,3a,75y,236.15h,110.9t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1ssK_tbr_p1T4ptH_l-JTW2A!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DsK_tbr_p1T4ptH_l-JTW2A%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.share%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26yaw%3D236.14632570527976%26pitch%3D-20.897264269594658%26thumbfov%3D90!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205410&entry=ttu), not around on Thl362.
* AH16 and AH121 are clearly signed going thru Mukdahan, not around on Thl238.
* AH18 may have moved onto the new bypass of Pattani.
* AH112 is unsigned.
