**Notes (general)**

LA DOTD is in the midst (early stages) of a "right-sizing" program aimed at reducing the total state highway mileage by 25% or more. This process will eliminate or shorten many of the highways in the set. Any reports of signs being changed, or removed from former state highways, will be appreciated. More info can be found at the links below:

When available, GMSV imagery was used to ensure highways were signed. In cases where imagery was not available (or predated a highway's designation), signage was assumed. Field checking these routes would be appreciated:

547<br>
826<br>
897-4<br>
897-5<br>
1018-3<br>
1018-4<br>
1018-5<br>
1266<br>
3102


**Notes (individual highways)**

LA8 is signed well along I-49, and signed partially along LA1, between I-49(103) and LA1200. The segment linking I-49 exit 103 to LA1 is considered LA8Spr by LA DOTD but is not signed as such, so it is not included in the set. Some LA8 signs remain on LA1, at least one with a TO banner, so these are being treated as remnants of a past routing.

LA26 is signed W-E at its west end and S-N at its south end.

LA29Spr is the western segment of LA26 (Chataignier St) within the one-way pair of US167/LA10 in Ville Platte.

LA44 is signed W-E at its east end and S-N at its north end.

LA77 is signed along LA77 Spur, and the adjacent section of LA77 is unsigned.

LA124's route through Harrisonburg is not completely clear since LA8 was routed onto a new bridge.

LA467-1 is documented in LA DOTD's State Route Report (2018) but not shown on maps.

The northern segment of LA486 is (mostly) unsigned, so it has not been included in the file.

The western end of LA611-1 is unclear.

Both LA631 and LA631 Spur are signed LA631, so the shorter leg at the west end was drafted as the spur.

Both LA655 and LA655 Spur are signed LA655, so the shorter leg on the west side of Bayou Lafourche was drafted as the spur.

The northern end of LA731 is unclear.

Both LA758 and LA758 Spur are signed LA758, so the short segment connecting the main route to LA29 was drafted as the spur.

The northern end of LA807 is unclear. It no longer reaches the state line.

Given the lack of GMSV for the area, LA897-1 thru 897-6 are drafted according to best guesses from http://wwwsp.dotd.la.gov/Inside_LaDOTD/Divisions/Multimodal/Data_Collection/Mapping/District%20Maps/District_58.pdf. LA DOTD has been contacted for further information.

LA987-3 and LA987-3 Spur are both signed on the same road, and what appears to be the spur is signed LA987-3, so the shorter road was drafted as LA987-3 Spur.

LA1055 is not signed along LA450 or LA38 according to GMSV, so the 2 segments of LA1055 were drafted separately.

Both LA1077 and LA1077 Spur are signed LA1077, so the very short leg diverging to the northwest was drafted as the spur.

The northern end of LA1093-1 is unclear.

The northern end of LA1129 is unclear.

Both LA1194 and LA1194 Spur are signed LA1194, so the spur was assigned to segment shown on DOTD maps as the spur.

LA1208-4 was signed as part of LA1208-1 in the most recent GMSV imagery (June 2015).

The northern end of LA1255 is unclear.

Both LA3000 and LA3000 Spur are signed LA3000, so the spur was assigned to segment shown on DOTD maps as the spur.

Both ends of LA 3046 are unclear. Signage is minimal but there are no other numbers assigned to Causeway Blvd, which is considered a state highway for most of its length according to maps. The south end of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway deserves another look as well.

Both LA3100 and LA3100 Spur are signed LA3100, so the spur was assigned to segment shown on DOTD maps as the spur.

The eastern end of LA3156 is unclear.

The western end of LA3258 is unclear.
