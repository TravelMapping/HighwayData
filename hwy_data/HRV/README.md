**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- `D10`: A4 wp is indicated "1" on OSM, D41 wp "2", Z3079 wp "3" et cetera. However, D41 is "1" on GSV, Z3079 "2" et cetera. The recently opened segment (September 2ß16) is not yet on GSV but numbered with "1" and "2" on OSM again! BM is like GSV but the new segment is missing. I've decided to go with A3, D41, Z3070 et cetera wp labels for the time being.
- Numbering is usually not used on signage but there are km posts which are quite small and hard to find. I've checked 15 routes only and I always found a km post! At additional 2 routes GSV and GM still had old numbering. For that reason, I'll rely on wikipedia and OSM only.
- `D431` is 400m only, exact location unknown: "Slavonski Brod (DC53 – GPC zona Đ. Đaković)"
- `D433` routing unknown despite being well described: "Solin (DC432) – Ulica salonitanskih mučenika – Zagorski put – Ulica domovinskog rata – Split (DC8)"
- `D542` routing unknown, not yet existing? "Zajci (DC64) – Polje Čepić (DC500)"
- `D8`/`D674` Pelješki bridge numbering: https://www.skyscrapercity.com/threads/440820/post-179777012
