**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-10 - Aube:*
- Routes through Troyes are often signed inbound at `D610` ring road but not within the city. Only routes drafted through the city when the routing is obviously.
- `D77` through BFC is signed on a mileposts indicating `Aube`
- `D82` through BFC is signed on a mileposts indicating `Aube`

*FRA-52 - Haute-Marne:*
- `D2A` is just a one-way street to the north in Wassy while the southbound street is `D2`, not included but threated as `D2` for wp location
- `D65B` is also indicated being `D65A`, added as `D65B` only
- `D111` and `D157` are not signed in the north of Saint-Dezier, excluded

*FRA-54 - Meurthe-et-Moselle:*
- `D2H`, `D2M` and `D2N` are indicated on OSM and GSV but not on GM/wikisara. Added though.
- `D2L` is indicated on OSM, GM and GSV but not on wikisara. Added though.
- `D6` extends into Vosges and back to Meurthe-et-Moselle. There are `D6` signs in Vos. Included.
- `D22A` is indicated on GM, GSV and wikisara but not on OSM. Added though.
- `D22E` is indicated on GM and wikisara but not on OSM or GSV. Not in HB.
- `D33` and `D33A` are partially indicated on OSM and GM but there is only one `D33A` sign at the junction of both routes. Not in HB.
- `D39`, `D92A`, `D93`, `D92A`, `D92B` and `D92C` are indicated on OSM and GM (western Nancy) but not on wikisara nor GSV. Start and end points not clear. Not in HB. If they would exist they had most likely been renamed to Mxxx.
- `D92` is indicated on OSM and GM through western Nancy but not on wikisara nor GSV. End point not clear, set to western city entrance.
- `D199` end point is wild guess, only signed at roundabout with `D400`
- `D974B` is the old alignment - bypass opened in 2018 or 2019 - which is still indicated being `D974` on OSM, to be checked before activation
- It seems that some route segments are dedicated as M routes (not yet considered when drafting routes!): https://routes.fandom.com/wiki/M%C3%A9tropole_du_Grand_Nancy (`M2`, `M32`, `M71`, `M83`, `M112`, `M321`,`M400`,`M570`, `M974`)

*FRA-55 - Meuse:*
- `D1916` is only signed `Voie Sacrée`, in HB as `fran` route `NVS`
- `D145x` routes are drafted as good as possible. OSM is partially incorrect, GSV not fully available
- `D163B` is only indicated on GM but not on OSM nor OSM - not included

*FRA-57 - Moselle:*
- `D8A` is indicated on GM and wikisara but not on OSM/GSV. Added though.
- `D33` exist according to OSM and GSV but GM claims that the northern segment is `D82A`
- `D77` extends into Meurthe-et-Moselle and back to Moselle but there are no `D9` mileposts in MeM (km12 still in Mos, km13 again in Mos) - not included
- `D104K` is signed as `C4` at `D37` junction but there is a `D104K` sign at the entrance of Glasenberg, whole route in HB
- `D199D` is missing, `D199` is likely signed incorrect since no other `D1xx` route exists without suffix
- It seems that from 2020-01-01 some route segments will be dedicated as M routes (not yet considered when drafting routes!): https://routes.fandom.com/wiki/Metz_M%C3%A9tropole#En_g.C3.A9n.C3.A9ral (`M1`, `M6`, `M7`, `M11`, `M69`, `M157A`,`M157B`,`M603`, `M643`, `M652`, `M657`, `M903`, `M913`, `M953`, `M954`, `M955`, `M999`)

*FRA-6ae - Alsace:*
- `D30` segment between `D392` and `D1420` is not available in shp files from January 2020 but on the renumbering map from April 2020 (w/o number) and is clearly signed on 2019 GSV, added
- `D25` north end is `D53` according to shp files from January 2020 but it is very short (0.11mi) and clearly signed as `D25` on 2019 + 2023 GSV
- `M63` south end of shp files ignored (short segment of Rue d'Entzheim) as it is very short (0.03mi) and not signed according to September 2022 + 2024 GSV
- `D303` is the former `D103` in Haut-Rhin, renumbered with the merger. January 2020 shp files do have a `D303` in Bas-Rhin (Wissembourg, northern extension of `D263`) which is also indicated on OSM but not on GM nor GSV. There are no duplicates and since the southern `D303` was renamed, the northern one cannot exist. Not drafted the latter in Wissembourg
- `M445` south end (south of railway) on OSM differs to shp files, shp route is permanently closed according to 2008 + 2019 + 2022 GSV, drafted according to OSM
- `D503` is signed at junction with `D3`/`D51` but does not extend to the junction according to shp files, not extended
- `D522` of shp files is only a ramp of an interchange and there is another `D522`in Haut-Rhin, not drafted
- `D528` is only a short one-way street of `D28`, not drafted
- `D753` should exist according to shp files + GM but nothing on GSV, OSM nor renumbering map, drafted though because it is very short (0.4mi), maybe too small for the renumbering map
- `M763` is only a short one-way street of `M63`, not drafted
- `D2063` should exist according to shp files + OSM but nothing on GSV, GM nor renumbering map, not drafted beacuse it is 1.8mi long and would be easily visible on the renumbering map but isn't

*FRA-88 - Vosges:*
- `D9` extends into Meurthe-et-Moselle and back to Vosges. There are `D9` milepost in MeM. Included.
- `D22` extends into Haute-Marne a little bit and back to Vosges. Included.
- `D57` mostly leads through BFC(70) but belong to GES(88), see https://routes.fandom.com/wiki/Route_d%C3%A9partementale_fran%C3%A7aise_D57_(70)
- `D182` is signed at the border stone with both departements
