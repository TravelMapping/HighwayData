The following routes are not included due to apparent lack of signage:
* R-5 through Rancagua and Temuco (traffic is directed onto the bypass, which in both cases is inventoried as not having a designation)
* R-32
* R-44 (as of 2013)
* R-118
* R-120
* R-125
* R-178
* R-194
* R-252

Notes on routes:
* R-1Ant may be unsigned, but it's part of a longer route that is signed.
* R-5: it's not known whether this turns east on V-970 to the ferry, but it is definitely [signed on the bypass at V-895](https://youtu.be/e1PGaGp692k?t=434).
* R-5Cas: according to the [2018 log](http://www.vialidad.cl/areasdevialidad/gestionvial/Documents/redvialnacional2018.pdf), the south end is at km 1271.375 (GalRiv). GIS shows the route turning left at RamFre to the waterfront at Jorge Vivar. And according to a [2009 decree](http://www.vialidad.cl/areasdevialidad/vialidadurbana/Biblitoteca%20Decretos/DSN_583_13-04-2009_X.pdf), it turns left at CGomGar to reach the ferry slip. Due to the lack of signage, ending the route at CGomGar may be most logical.
* R-30 is signed as its former designation R-5, [even in 2020](https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=-27.304031137029696&lng=-70.43525402445545&z=16.176812409712305&focus=photo&pKey=R2v7OMgV-LS3Etz9d7U9Ng&x=0.6041665253696347&y=0.5020128683865258&zoom=0.5070422535211268), so perhaps it should be renamed R-5Cop.
* R-43 may have an incorrect north end due to limited recent coverage (all from YouTube).
* R-47 [is signed](https://youtu.be/tSxaUXZ9ReA?t=1036).
* R-71 is erroneously [signed as G-71](https://www.google.com/maps/@-33.1492543,-70.794179,3a,41.3y,260.07h,80.47t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s_QnHVbP3oqBs_vAyLWmiYg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) despite existing as a national route since 1998 (and previously being part of R-57). But at least [one text sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-33.1604532,-70.7936792,3a,20.9y,10.63h,89.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sEatV3vB3ahGe0OJ198jxkA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) does call it R-71.
* R-72 does not appear to be signed, but it's a freeway so it belongs in chlsf.
* R-73 does not appear to be signed on the route, but is [on R-57](https://www.google.com/maps/@-33.2496832,-70.6976737,3a,15y,323.79h,100.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1seCLsAzom1KM044dkgCiUJQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).
* R-74 is not officially designated, though with a Código of 73A00074 it should be. Anyway, it's in chlsf as Avenida General Velásquez.
* R-77 does not appear to be signed, but it of course belongs in chlsf as Autopista Nororiente. But the number was only assigned in 2012, so it's possible it's been signed since 2015 (the latest GMSV available).
* R-79: ditto; signs are for Acceso Sur
* R-126 is not inventoried between R-128_E and Los Alamos in southern Cauquenes, but [signs are posted](https://www.google.com/maps/@-35.9816155,-72.3160906,3a,17y,18.88h,93.19t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sDsMbbwoSXiyH9cFlOFQaKg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) to fill the gap.
* R-150 is [still signed in 2020](https://www.mapillary.com/app/?lat=-36.75678003577075&lng=-73.00270175316206&z=17&focus=photo&pKey=F8BD8QEOv5JYejcbdwbEgA) as using the old route through Penco. The bypass can go in chlsf.
* R-151 (Ruta Interportuaria Talcahuano - Penco) is not officially designated, but with a Código of 68A10151 it should be. Anyway, it belongs in chlsf, as does a branch that GIS data calls URBRU164 (the main route is URBRU151).
* R-152 appears on [at least one sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-36.6510046,-72.2250395,3a,18.3y,272h,95.23t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1snzkMXTMiXUdXy4vKOrOOPg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).
* R-154 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-36.7930483,-73.0645748,3a,17.5y,173.81h,89.65t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sonOQT5wu7SjbxprS0MyGMw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).
* R-160: the south end is according to the [2018 log](http://www.vialidad.cl/areasdevialidad/gestionvial/Documents/redvialnacional2018.pdf) (km 138.625). GIS data shows it two blocks west.
* R-177 is signed as [Ex-R-5](https://www.google.com/maps/@-37.4260984,-72.3349542,3a,15y,353.2h,82.08t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sKvY3-3ANA9G9dssJnV-0fg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).
* R-204 [is signed](https://youtu.be/TDdtbidFj3o?t=331).
* R-208 and R-210 were not signed as of 2013, but there's a good chance they've been signed since (like R-204, signed since 2013).
* R-225CH is inventoried as beginning at V-505, but it is signed from R-5.
* R-226 [is signed](https://youtu.be/NEMuh8Rmsws?t=1631).
* R-231CH [is signed](https://youtu.be/J87hPiOt0rk?t=137).
* R-235CH [is signed](https://youtu.be/gwr4r8GA6CY?t=607).
* R-243CH [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-45.5509912,-71.9303658,3a,38.4y,114.23h,71.79t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s7HdRebnWPkbl4d3xl6HFJQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) as its former designation, R-240CH, at least in 2014.
* R-250CH, R-251CH, and R-253CH may be unsigned due to their short lengths, but the newest photos available of signs are from 2014.
* R-265CH [is signed](https://youtu.be/jPsfZeugz7E?t=1025) (on the guide sign to the right, coming from the side road).
