Unsigned concurrencies are treated as gaps between separate routes unless the concurrency follows a single route between splits in the same county.

Instead of Alternate, Business, Truck, or Spur banners, auxiliary routes are posted with suffixes (i.e. AR 00 Business = "AR 00B"). Route names for these auxiliary routes follow the same convention (AR00B instead of AR00Bus, with or without city label). Signage for some spurs is "Spur #S": this is treated as a bannerless #S (similar situation with at least one truck route).

**Notes:**

AR9S in Izard County has 3 legs, all signed AR9S: 2 horizontal (AR9SMel) and 1 vertical (AR9SIza)

AR18 intersects AR181 twice in Mississippi County; both junctions are signed "AR 181 East"

AR32 intersects US278 twice in Hempstead County; both junctions are signed "AR 32 East"

AR35 is unsigned in Sheridan between US167Bus_N and US167_S but follows a path that was a single route before the bypass was built

AR43 intersects AR7 twice in Harrison; both junctions are signed "AR 43 South"

AR88Alt is AR88 (Altheimer)

AR92 is signed N-S south of the AR9 concurrency and E-W east of it

AR94 is unsigned from AR340 to the Missouri state line

AR100 intersects AR365 twice in Pulaski County; both junctions are signed "AR 100 East" and the gap is longer than either segment of AR100

The two segments of AR127 in Madison County are separated by a gap (along AR23) longer than either segment

Two segments of AR160 in Calhoun, Bradley, and Ashley Counties are separated by a gap (along AR8) that is only 4 miles long across the Bradley-Ashley county line, so they have been joined (as AR160Her)

The two segments of AR200 in Nevada County are separated by a gap (along US371) longer than either segment

AR212Gou is longer than AR212 (Star City), but AR212 (Staves) has the name AR212Sta

The two segments of AR244 in Washington County are separated by a gap (along AR59) longer than either segment

AR253 intersects AR45 twice in Sebastian County; both junctions are signed "AR 253 North"

AR285 intersects both US65 and AR124 twice, via three separate segments, so these are being treated separately since it is not clear that AR285 is concurrent with either of them

Two segments of AR234 in Little River and Sevier Counties are separated by a gap (along US71) that is only 5 miles long across the county line, so they have been joined (as AR234)

AR264Sil is signed E-W with W end at Brashears Rd

The two segments of AR277 in Desha County are separated by a gap (along US165) longer than either segment

Two segments of AR295 in Madison County are separated by a gap (along AR16) longer than either segment

Per USGS 1:2400 topo map, AR296's west end is on the TX/AR state line

AR312 intersects AR18 twice in Mississippi County; both junctions are signed "AR 312 East"

Two segments of AR333 in Searcy County are separated by a gap (along US65) longer than either segment

AR391 stub N of I-40 is unsigned

AR922-1A is signed AR722-1A on US165, which is the only signage viewable on GMSV

AR933-1 and AR933-2 are signed at AR9 & AR5, respectively, but imagery is too blurry to determine if they are signed -1/-2 or -1A/-2A

All 32 AR980 routes have a suffix so that renaming will not be necessary if any change length or are (de)commissioned in the future

**To be determined:**

AR43 in OK (westward bend along OK20): AR43 is concurrent with OK20 along state line, but bends west for some distance to be totally within OK, so should have points where it crosses state line; no corresponding state-line points exist in OK20 file

AR75S is signed "Truck AR 75S"

AR151 in usaar is longer than the AR151 in usansf and deserves to be free of a suffix, but is correcting this worth the trouble?

N end of AR162 (maps show continuing to I-40 along US71B)

N end of AR926 (no imagery besides jct with US270, not shown in ArDOT maps)
