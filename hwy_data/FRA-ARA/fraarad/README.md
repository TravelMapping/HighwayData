**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-01 - Ain:*
- `D117A` extended to `D1075` because it was opened in November 2019 - shp files from March 2019 does not yet have it
- `D884B` to `D884E` are ramps of interchanges only, not drafted
- `D936` drafted via Saint-Trivier-sur-Moignans bypass opened Dec 2019 - shp files from March 2019 still have it through the village
- `D1075A` and `D1075B` are ramps of (former) interchanges only, not drafted

*FRA-03 - Allier:*
- `D28` extends into Cher (departement 18 in CVL) more than once. The border sign is a little bit off the actual border and the pavement change is in CVL. Route extended to next junction at `D951`
- `D951` of Cher (departement 18 in CVL) has a short segment in ARA but there are no signs at the border, no pavement change and a km post indicating km48, should belong to fracvld18 system

*FRA-07 - Ardèche:*
- `D51` might belong to departement Gard (30) in OCC - there are no signs at the border and both extensions into OCC are indicated as `D51`. However, `D52` had to be in OCC too because it is only connected to `D51` but its number changes at the border. Both drafted for Ardèche.

*FRA-15 - Cantal:*
- `D12` of departement Lozère goes through Cantal (no signs at the border, there is a milepost indicating `D12` and there another `D12` in Cantal)
- `D16` of departement Lot goes through Cantal (no signs at the border, there is another `D16` in Cantal)
- `D25` crosses the border to Lot and Aveyron multiple times; fully drafted for Cantal
- `D42` of departement Aveyron extends into Cantal up to `D141`/`D601` junction, see mileposts
- `D163` of departement Aveyron extends into Cantal up to `D990` junction
- `D227` goes through departement Corrèze, see milepost, no border signs
- `D320` is indicated twice on OSM and GM but the segment north of Montsalvy as an alternative route to D920 is not signed according to GSV; not drafted
- `D926` Saint-Flour bypass was opened in 2020, new route is `D926` but numbering of old route in unknown (`D921` routing and `D721` eastern extension are just wild guess)
- `D990` through departement Aveyron (OCC) - there are two segments - are most likely part of the Cantal system. There are no signs or change of pavement at the borders like we usually have at borders of Cantal and Aveyron borders. Wikipedia does not mention that N590 had been declassified to departement Aveyron: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_nationale_590; drafted for Cantal

*FRA-26 - Drôme:*
- `D18` and `D20` drafted to the best of my knowledge. They could also be maintained by the PAC departement Hautes-Alpes
- `D56`, `D128` and `D540` signs at Boulevard de l'Europe in Montélimar disappeared between 2019 and 2020 according to GSV. I assume that the same happened to other routes like `D4` where 2020 GSV is not available; routes truncated to outer ring road
- `D237` in Montélimar also disappeared at N7 in 2020

*FRA-38 - Isère:*
- `D36` (Chasse-sur-Rhône) extends at west end according to wikisara and GM but not according to GSV and OSM. Signs have been removed between 2008 an 2015 according to GSV.
- `D41I` should be `D41L` according to wikisara and GM but it is clearly signed as `D41I` on GSV. OSM confirms it. Note: upper case letters are generally used.
- `D63I` should be `D65L` according to wikisara and GM but it is clearly signed as `D65I` on GSV - with lower case `i`. OSM confirms it. Only exception with lower case index.
- `D208` should extend through Bourgoin-Jallieu according to wikisara and GM but OSM indicates it being `D522` and 2019 GSV doesn't show anything being signed.

*FRA-42 - Loire:*
- `N7` from Roanne to Lyon was downgraded with the opening of A89 in 2018 according to wikisara but no new numbering is known. December 2020 GSV still indicates `N7`. Drafted as route departement `N7`.
- `D36` from Saint-Charmond to Saint-Paul-en-Jarez is indicated on OSM + GM but west and east end are not clear, GSV shows no signs nor mileposts at all, not drafted
- `D335` in Saône-et-Loire (BFC) is indicated on OSM and GM but 2018 GSV does not show it; there is a `D35` milepost at west end and `D35` signs to the west and to the east at `D27` junction --> route most likely belong to departement Loire's `D35`

*FRA-43 - Haute-Loire:*
- The second `D9` segment south of Saint-Bonnet-le-Froid must belong to the ARA Ardeche departement (fraarad07). `D9` is signed at the junction and there is a `Info Ardeche` sign along the route.
- `D12` through Loire seems to be maintained by Haute-Loire
- The second `D45` segment in the south of the departement (OSM + GM, no GSV available) seems to belong to OCC Lozère departement (fraoccd48)

*FRA-63 - Puy-de-Dôme:*
- Some route segments will be dedicated as M routes (not yet considered when drafting routes!)
- wikisara articles are rare but OSM + GM look good
- `D80` is signed on km posts till 1km north of `D983` but as `D80A` at `D983` junction, drafted as `D80` only
- `D224D` is indicated being `D224E` on OSM and GM; `D224D` is confirmed by 2012 GSV

*FRA-69 - Rhone:*
- `N7` from Roanne to Lyon was downgraded with the opening of A89 in 2018 according to wikisara but no new numbering is known. December 2020 GSV still indicates `N7`. Drafted as route departement `N7`.
- `D35` through Saône-et-Loire is indicated as `D335` on OSM and GM but 2018 GSV does not show `D335`; there is a `D35` milepost at west end and `D35` signs to the west and to the east at `D27` junction --> route most likely belongs to departement Rhone's `D35`
- `D155` signs in Colombier have been removed according to 2020 GSV

*FRA-73 - Savoie:*
- OSM is sometimes outdated, new D route signs often appeared just on 2019 GSV

*FRA-74 - Haute-Savoie:*
- OSM is sometimes outdated, new D route signs often appeared just on 2019 GSV
- `D19` in Gaillard is not indicated anywhere on 2019 GSV nor 2009 GSV but it is clearly indicated on OSM and GM, added!
- `D909E` is indicated on OSM and GM but I couldn't find any sign. Route addded but needs to be checked again before activtion.
