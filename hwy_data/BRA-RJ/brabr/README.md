Notes on routes:
* BR-356Bar: there is no signage connecting through Campos to the remainder. GIS shows that BR-356 turns west on Avenida 28 de Março to Avenida Artur Bernardes, where federal maintenance ends, but there are no signs here, not even km posts. BR-356 is then planned along locally-maintained Avenida Artur Bernardes to BR-101.
* The following routes are not signed:
* * BR-040 south of BR-101 (including Túnel Prefeito Marcello Alencar or the former Elevado da Perimetral)
* * BR-120
* * BR-393 east of BR-116
* * BR-459
* * BR-484
* * BR-485 (unbuilt gap and north of the gap)
* * BR-492
* * BR-494
