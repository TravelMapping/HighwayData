Signage in the field guides vehicles exiting the ferry terminal/customs house to turn left on Lonsleira and then right on Austurvegur to follow route 93, with no indication of route 93 heading in the other direction from the ferry terminal. Route is plotted to follow field signage rather than Vegagerdin map.

215	Done
218	Done. Vegagerdin map shows both forks at southern end as 218. Signage in field does not explicitly indicate either as being part of the route. Mapped along eastern fork since this is straight through the intersection where the two meet and this is a much higher quality road. Western fork not mapped due to lack of signage pointing to it.

726	Done
727	Not known if signed but unnumbered on Vegagerdin map, so omitted. Will add if signage in field is confirmed.
731	Done
732 Mentioned on diagrammatic sign (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iceland_4721.JPG) but not on Vegagerdin map and appears to be just a driveway. Omitted, will add if signage at junction is confirmed.
733	Confirmed signed 2/4/18 - added (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iceland_4721.JPG)
734	Done. Shown by Vegagerdin map and OSM as converting to F734 at bridge over Strangakvisl. However, there are several unbridged streams north of this point, which are charactaristic of F-roads. Also, there is a 4-way junction with 756 north of this point, which while it is marked on Vegagerdin map as 756 is known to be signed from 35 as F756. 734 is therefore assumed to convert to F734 at Fossar, where quality of road visibly downgrades and OSM changes the road class.
735	Done

755	Not known if signed but unnumbered on Vegagerdin map, so omitted. Will add if signage in field is confirmed.
756	Signed as F756 from 35, shown as 756 on Vegagerdin map. Appears to be low quality over most of its length (unbridged streams, snowdrifts on road indicating lack of winter maintenance), so assumed to be F756 in entirety and omitted from this system.
757	Not known if signed but unnumbered on Vegagerdin map, so omitted. Will add if signage in field is confirmed.
758	Done
759	Done. Unnumbered on Vegagerdin map, assumed to end at end of road.
762	Done. Unnumbered on Vegagerdin map, assumed to end at end of road.
764	Done. Signed at both junctions with 75. Old signage at southern point indicates only western leg as 764, assumed to be out of date. Vegagerdin map shows both legs as 764.
765	Old signage at the southern point of 764 indicates that the eastern leg of 764 is 765, as is the road leading south from this point. Vegagerdin map does not show 765 designation on either. 765 plotted as road to south only since road to north has newer signage at 75 marking it as 764, and is shown as 764 on Vegagerdin map.

916	Done
917	Done. Appears to have been recently rerouted to end north of Vopnafjordur rather than west of it - Vegagerdin Map and Google show this, OSM shows routing west of town with new road north of town absent, and GMSV from August 2013 shows signage along west routing with north routing under construction. Mapped following north routing.
918	Unsigned

952	Unsigned
953	Done
954 Done. Vegagerdin map shows as ending at Eskifjordur city limits, but is signed at intersection with 92, so plotted with west end at 92. East end plotted where Vegagerdin map shows designation changing from S954 to S958 (assumed to be unsigned, see below).
955	Done
958	Assumed to be unsigned since it does not begin or end at an intersection and, while there is no SV, neither intermediate intersection appears from satellite imagery to have any large signs.
962	Done. Unnumbered on Vegagerdin map, assumed to end at end of road.
964	Done
966	Done. Part of road is missing from OSM, coords for point +X04 taken from Vegagerdin map

998	Unsigned
5317	Done

There are many 4-digit numbered routes on the Vegagerdin Map, OSM, etc. 5317 is the only one I have any evidence is signed in the field. It seems like they are not supposed to be and either 5317 is signed in error (from both ends!) or is an odd exception.
