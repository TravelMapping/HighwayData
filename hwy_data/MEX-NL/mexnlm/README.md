Notes:
* M2 may continue east or west
* M6 probably continues east and west but I can't find any more signs - but what's [this](https://www.google.com/maps/@25.5941279,-100.2607383,3a,16y,199.14h,101.73t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1smbQ5JAHva2l9EFEKV0-34Q!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D-11.731894428506223%26panoid%3DmbQ5JAHva2l9EFEKV0-34Q%26yaw%3D199.13627297256838!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDgyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)? There seems to be nothing else for this segment, which was first signed between 2019 and 2021.
* M18 is signed on M39 but not somewhere that makes sense
* M21 no signs south of M20
* M26 no idea how to handle westbound, which is clearly signed on Washington/Garza Sada past M9-A
* M31 was signed at the east end of M4, but it no longer is and I can't find any other current or former signage there
* M32 I can't find any signs west of AvePedInf
* M32Cen only signed at east end
* M34 not sure if it continues east
* M37 signed to continue south from M12, but I can't find any signage beyond
* M38Nic may continue east
* M39 not sure where the south end is, so I put it where pavement changes; I can't find any signs north of M910
* M40 may continue east
* M42 Does this continue west?
* M47 I can't find any signs south of M16
* M210 not sure how to handle the south leg
* M1610 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@25.7404251,-100.5253902,3a,15y,172.29h,89.32t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1FTMVoG754CrjSx260OwIA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) but most signs just say [Perif√©rico Cuota](https://www.google.com/maps/@25.6288207,-100.0724351,3a,28y,326.12h,94.9t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sXe2vtHRrC_8c1N5k-x1r4A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu).
