* BR-164 has a piece under construction southeast from Tapira to either Sâo Roque de Minas (per state map) or BR-464 (per GIS), but there is no imagery available for most of the route, so no way to know if it is signed.
* BR-251's [federal maintenance ends](https://www.google.com/maps/@-16.6950212,-43.817774,3a,38.9y,262.71h,78.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s94Osg-PAPnfKZprLeQUE8g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) just west of [km 526](https://www.google.com/maps/@-16.6945345,-43.8173409,3a,75y,217.3h,77.65t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sXcVVe7NwuxlUeY_cVALvbA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu), which is not what the state map and GIS show. Since the route signed with destinations thru Montes Claros is not the one shown in GIS, the file ends where federal maintenance does.
* BR-251Una: all sources show that federal maintenance ends at Par, but it is [signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-16.7666578,-46.1329342,3a,30.9y,288.42h,81.39t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sAAiBd8ymWsFeYkQbRjjQ_g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) with km posts east of there.
* BR-259 is probably unsigned between BR-381 and BR-116 north of Governador Valdares, but there is no imagery available on the unpaved portion, and it connects the signed federally-maintained portion to the east with the signed state-maintained portion to the west.

* BR-352 [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-19.3189209,-45.2353103,3a,41.3y,212.7h,79.05t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdAyLowbNnhBHRe9TafYj3A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) near Abaeté. Other signage is sparse and perhaps nonexistent, but this piece is federally maintained.
* BR-352Cor [is signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-18.4686346,-47.4073106,3a,15.5y,299.76h,83.89t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sCE-wZdty6aAj14gA5A3Vmg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) where paved west of Coromandel, but the unpaved portion seems to be unsigned.
