**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-44 - Loire-Atlantique:*
- shp accuracy for border coordinates seem to be better based on km posts in the field than those from Maine-et-Loire's shp files but the latter was drafted first
- M route indication on OSM and GM is not consistent and GSV is often not recent enough (pre-2020), to be checked with updated GSV

*FRA-49 - Maine-et-Loire:*
- There is a shp file `D149V` connecting the two `D149-85` routes. `V` might stand for Vendée, not drafted as -49 route

*FRA-72 - Sarthe:*
- Numbering in Saint-Calais is a mess on OSM, GM and 2018 GSV, to be checked with updated GSV
- `D209` routing through Courcemont is drafted according to GM and 2009 GSV(!), OSM shows a different routing though. To be checked with updated GSV
- `D295` sign at `D53` appeared anytime between 2011 and 2018 but GSV at `D23` is from 2016 only. To be checked with updated GSV if route extends to `D23`
