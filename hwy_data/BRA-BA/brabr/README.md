Notes on routes:
* BR-235 [is signed](https://youtu.be/lGgngPTsxPs?t=127) around Canudos.
* BR-324 may be almost entirely unsigned west of BR-407 to Umburanas. Except between Marotinho and Jacobina, this segment was taken over federally between 2013 and 2018, but as of 2022 it doesn't seem to be signed, and [the west end](https://www.google.com/maps/@-10.7226732,-41.306337,3a,17.7y,286.51h,113.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sDe6Sjxdl5ZMfCN6HcTaDfg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) is signed as BA-368. There is [at least one nonstandard sign](https://www.google.com/maps/@-11.1649918,-40.5474246,3a,32y,171.29h,86.29t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sn4YgarvYgN8WIKzXhM4_bg!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu) at Jacobina.
* BR-367 is unsigned west of BR-101 (as of 2019 near the state line and 2014 elsewhere).
