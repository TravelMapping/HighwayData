Notes on routes:
* BR-060: GIS and the 2018 state map show it using Avenida Frei Miguelino in western Goiânia, but this is not signed and partly only two lanes.
* BR-060: As of 2017, this is [signed](https://www.google.com/maps/@-17.9153218,-51.7685123,3a,24.8y,296.27h,89.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sLh-QUPwDAbwTL5VTBF3ftA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) south of Jataí, but beyond Serranópolis signs are only for [GO-184](https://www.google.com/maps/@-18.304775,-51.9626757,3a,47.1y,285.25h,76.59t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0NDE7-7heOfEEaoE6_J8ng!2e0!7i13312!8i6656). Note that GIS currently shows BR-060 planned to split from BR-364 farther west, at GO-050.
