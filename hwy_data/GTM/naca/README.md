Notes on routes:
* ca001 seems to have had a landslide between ToHUE6 and HUE6, but maps and logs (20.95 km between Bifurcacion Colotenango and Bifurcacion La Libertad) show it still uses the old route. 2016 GMSV shows traffic to Huehuetenango also directed along the old route, with a not-so-great unpaved detour around the slide.
* ca001: TOT22 is shown on maps (back to 2014) as paved, but it was a dirt track (impassable to cars?) in 2016. Hence it is a hidden shaping point.
* ca001: there is no GMSV of the Chimaltenango bypass, but there is a video on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2HJ2Uf23QI
* ca001: there is no GMSV of the Barberena bypass, but there is a video on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AKlohkfElU
* ca002: SCH3 is signed at Sam; is this a case of the map being wrong?
* ca002: ESC26 does not appear to exist as a public road, so it's a shaping point.
* ca002: signage is horrible through Escuintla, but it's not signed around the bypass.
* ca002tec may extend farther south into town.
* ca009sur: the location of ESC1 may be wrong.
* ca010: the location of RN18_E may be wrong.
* ca013: the location of PET23 may be wrong.
* ca013ele: the west end may be wrong.
* ca014: BV2_W is far to the south of where maps show a road.
* ca014: the north end may be too far west.
