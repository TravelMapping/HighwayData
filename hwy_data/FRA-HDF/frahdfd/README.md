**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
*FRA-20 - Aisne:*
- General note: OSM is often wrong compared to 2018 or 2019 GSV; If "old" e.g. 2010 GSV is also available, there is usually no change in signage. That means, I'd also trust 2009 or 2010 GSV even when only this is available.
- `D1140` is signed at `D1044` junction according to 2019 GSV and ends at border to GES in HB but since Gernicourt changed from HDF to GES in 2017 the situation is not clear and must be revisited

*FRA-59 - Nord:*
- `D643` through Pas-de-Calais seems to belong to Nord

*FRA-60 - Oise:*
- wikisara has a full ist but is sometimes outdated
- e.g. `D503`, `D514`, `D514E`, `D563L`, `D566E`, `D592` and `D593` are unsigned now

*FRA-62 - Pas-de-Calais:*
- `D15` through Nord seems to belong to Pas-de-Calais (there is a `D15` sign in Nord and there is also another one in Nord)
- `D27` through Somme might also belong to Pas-de-Calais but there are no signs and there is not another one in Somme but all other routes from D1 to D169 exist)
- `D119` through Somme seems to belong to Pas-de-Calais (there is also another one in Somme)
- `D166` through Nord seems to belong to Pas-de-Calais (there are three short segments in Nord)
- `D213` through Nord seems to belong to Pas-de-Calais (there is also another one in Nord which is indiacted as `D213.2` on OSM and GM but is clearly signed as `D213` on GSV)
- `D941` through Nord seems to belong to Pas-de-Calais

*FRA-80 - Somme:*
- OSM often indicates wrong numbers or misses many D routes (especially `D2xx`) which are clearly visible on GM and on 2018 or 2019 GSV - routes added according to GSV; it seems that the routes are newly dedicated as D routes
- `D4929` was still signed according to 2015 GSV (OSM+GM confirm it) but the signs were removed according to 2017 GSV
