**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- `H1` is not signed in Geneve. GSV does not show signs and OSM does not have a continuous route through the town. In drove there in October 2016, the southernmost "1" sign I could see was at the rountabout with H121. However, I've extended the route to A1a because the official list (www.admin.ch) and all maps show H1 heading to Geneve.
