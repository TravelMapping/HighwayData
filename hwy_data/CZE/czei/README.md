**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- `I12`: It's the only `I` road within the Prague city limits but I dunno why (wikipedia info only?); GSV shows signs from D0 interchange
- `I20`: Not signed on GSV b/n I/3 and I/34
- `I47kro`: Not sure if continued till I55 through Komeriz
- There seem to be some `H` and `J` routes (old alignments) which are not signed
- `I8` should be truncated near the new D8 section and signed `II608` but I'm not sure where I8 will begin, at I63 or I13? There's also no info when it will be implemented; it was not yet done according to 2017-01-01 RSD.cz map.
