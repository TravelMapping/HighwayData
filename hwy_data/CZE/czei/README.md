**NOTES TO ROUTES:**
- `I8`: Couldn't see any I/8 signs in Prague on GSV but green D8 signs although the road has just "happy car" signs. According to OSM, it ends one interchange in front of MO --> it's eursf route now and I/8 ends at Prague city limit
- `I20`: Not signed on GSV b/n I/3 and I/34
- `I12`: It's the only I road within the Prague city limits but I dunno why (wikipedia info only?); should be checked, a quick GSV check showed a sign at I101 (Prague city limit) only and at I33310 signing to the east!
- `I26`: Stankov bypass was opened in November 2016; No info about `II185` routing (to southern or northern I26 junction?)
- `I47kro`: Not sure if continued till I55 through Komeriz
- There seem to be some `H` and `J` routes (old alignments) which are not signed
